This program demonstrates the use of Lambda Expressions, Multithreading, and Exception Handling in Java. 
Lambda expressions simplify thread creation by providing a shorter way to implement the Runnable interface. 
Multithreading allows multiple threads to run concurrently, enabling the “Hi” and “Hello” messages to print simultaneously. 
Exception handling, using try-catch and InterruptedException, ensures the program runs smoothly even if a thread is interrupted during execution.
